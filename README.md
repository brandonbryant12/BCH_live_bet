# This repository is a submission for the LBRY UNH Hackathon 10-19-18
##We are proposing a peer-to-peer live betting plugin on top of the LBRY protocol

#The problem with live betting today is that you must deposit crypto into a third party wallet and bet against the house.  

##The LBRY blockchain will allow users to remove the 'house' from the bet. 

##Allowing bets to be peer to peer will result in fee-less betting and users never have to deposit money with a third party

#Betting Protocol 

##Phase 1 
### Bet announcement (bet host)

##Phase 2
### Bet acceptance (bet client)

##Phase 3 
### LBRYBet create 2 of 3 multisig escrow

##Phase 4
### Bet Host funds escrow

##Phase 5
### Bet client funds escrow

##Phase 6 
### Game finishes and the escrow is signed over to winner
